          <h4>Go Green</h4>
          <p>
            India has a diverse ecosystem. But the country's forest cover is
            fast depleting due to industrilization and felling of trees for
            commercial use. We need to put a stop to this if we want to survive
            as a species; Junoon foundation's Go Green is a small step in the
            same direction.
